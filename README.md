# PCL2GRIDMAP Conversion



## 1. Prerequisites
PCL

## 2. Preprocessing for Generating Gridmap
Pointcloud map generated by monocular slam includes several outliers. To generate accurate and clean gridmap, the
process of removing outliers is needed. The output including only inliners is stored in pcd format.
[statistical outlier removal](https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/statistical_outlier.html)
```
cd build
./remove_outlier [pointcloud file]
```

## 3. Generating Gridmap from pointcloud map
The methodology for generating the gridmap is very simple. First, the generater scans the pcd file and estimate the
appropriate gridsize. Then push points to the corresponding grids. You can adjust the scaling factor or threshold in
the pcl2grid\_converter.py file.

```
cd src
python pcl2grid_converter.py [pointcloud file]
```

## 4. Loading Generated gridmap
```
python gridmap_loader.py [gridmap file]
```

## 5. Visualizing map and trajectory
```
python draw.py [pointcloud file] [framepose file]
```

## 5. TODO
A way to generate a gridmap with a uniform scale should be considered
